Got my errors fixed couldn't create an account. Had an error in my code. I also had MAJOR merge issues because I pulled down from main and my teammate had similar labeled files as mine. It imported in her migrations as well and I couldn't figure out why my code wasn't working.

Had a 401 error with my update function. It also wouldn't allow me to create the account again which was resolved yesterday.
Tangled up some end points - fixed those. Lastly, trying to get my DELETE fx to work. I think the router has an issue. Which is also causing my create acct to not work. No 500 error, just 401.
