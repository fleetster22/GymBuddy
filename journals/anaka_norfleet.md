# Anaka's Journey Towards Software Engineer :roller_coaster:

**8/14/23** Excalidraw complete, API Design Doc complete. Starting on database structure and users routers, models and queries :clapper:

---

**8/15/23** I am so excited that I completed the SQL database table creations and everything works. Now on to authentication! :clapper:

---

**8/16/23** I pushed my code up first thing this morning so everyone could have it. I helped Priya pull the code, address merge conflicts and get access to PGAdmin. I got a late start on authentication, but I did make some progress. More authentication tomorrow and I need to figure out how to code the HTTP requests for the 3rd party api. :guardsman:

---

**8/17/23** I didn't get to work on authentication today, but I did complete my queries and routers for exercises. Hopefully it works. I will test it tomorrow and troubleshoot if need be. Note to future self. Doublecheck the routers file endpoints. They may need to structured like/exercises?muscle=quadriceps. I will also watch a Youtube tutorial on Redux to see if I like it more than useState. Mischa says she loves it. I will go more in depth over the weekend into whichever state management I like best.
