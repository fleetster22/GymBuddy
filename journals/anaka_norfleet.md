# Anaka's Journey Towards Software Engineer :roller_coaster:

**8/14/23** Excalidraw complete, API Design Doc complete. Starting on database structure and users routers, models and queries :clapper:

---

**8/15/23** I am so excited that I completed the SQL database table creations and everything works. Now on to authentication! :clapper:

---

**8/16/23** I pushed my code up first thing this morning so everyone could have it. I helped Priya pull the code, address merge conflicts and get access to PGAdmin. I got a late start on authentication, but I did make some progress. More authentication tomorrow and I need to figure out how to code the HTTP requests for the 3rd party api. :guardsman:

---

**8/17/23** I didn't get to work on authentication today, but I did complete my queries and routers for exercises. Hopefully it works. I will test it tomorrow and troubleshoot if need be. Note to future self. Doublecheck the routers file endpoints. They may need to structured like/exercises?muscle=quadriceps. I will also watch a Youtube tutorial on Redux to see if I like it more than useState. Mischa says she loves it. I will go more in depth over the weekend into whichever state management I like best.

---

**8/20/23** I second guessed the exercise api functionality so I burned it to the ground and built it again. I also created the accounts queries and routers files using the FastAPI videos from Learn. I am going to catch up on homework now.

---

**8/23/23** The backend is working nicely. The frontend is giving me headaches. I built a page and when I went to view it in the browser, 4 errors. grrrrr.

---

**8/24/23** Well all of my accomplishments today can be summed up with, I barely managed to undo all the damage I did from yesterday.

---

**8/28/23** Today, Violet helped me understand the post request for exercises to crate a table. I worked on that mostly. Hopefully, I can finish soon so I can pair program with Priya.

**9/5/23** Worked with Phil last Thursday to help me debug the back end. He pointed me in right direction and I worked on it over the 4 day weekend to get it running. Today I tackled the Create Workout page. It is working and redirecting after form submission. Tomorrow, I will conquer the Workouts page.

---

**9/7/23** I spent most of today on front end auth. While waiting for Priya to push, I started learning Matplotlib in case we have time to put the progress chart in the app before it's due.

---

**9/8/23** Fingers crossed I get the remainder of front-end auth working and I will write some unit tests.

---

**9/11/23** Last day of project and we have our MVP. We did not achieve the stretch goals, but considering we only had 3 people on our team, we did an amazing job. I am happy with this MVP.
