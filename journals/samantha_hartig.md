8/10 created journal pages

8/17 Anaka reminded me to fill this out. I made the exercises endpoints. queries.exercises, routers.exercises and main.py have been updated.

8/22 Working on: create a page to show a way to select exercises with filters of type, muscle, or difficultly. These 3 items can be drop down selections with an "all" option.
Make cards on the page to show 10 exercises with: Name, type, muscle, equipment.
There needs to be an "add to workout" button so the exercises can be added to a specific workout.
The workout with the names of exercises and the order they are in should also be shown on the side.
The Workouts will be stored in a database tied to the user that created the workout.
Maybe later add ability to drag and drop to change the order. Would require { useDrag } from 'react-dnd'
